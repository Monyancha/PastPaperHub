# PastPaperHub

PastPaperHub (PPHub) is a place where students can find past papers and suggested answers. The past papers are hosted on Firebase while the answers are added by users via the Facebook comments plugin. Hosting is supported by Node and Expressjs.

The backend logic is written in JavaScript while the front end is basic HTML, CSS and some Jquery.

## Setting up the environment

Follow guidlines on how to set up Firebase here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/
After installing the Firebase CLI; Clone the code, make a few changes, then run `firebase serve` in the project's root folder.
You may need to add the project to your Google firebase account. run `firebase use` then select `Past paper hub` (this is probably not the real ID name). If you can't see the project in your firebase project list, contact the admin to add your account.

Do not make deletion from the Firebase database unless you have permission to do so.
